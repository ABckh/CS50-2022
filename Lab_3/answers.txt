sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Cause time for sorted5000, random5000 is not equal.
Than it is the only algorithm efficiency of which is not equal in both best and the worst scenarios.
This is the bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Cause time for sorted5000, reversed5000 and random5000 is equal. Also, the algorithm is faster than sort1 and sort2.
Based on this efficiency of the algorithm is Î˜(n log n). This is the merge sort.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Cause time for sorted5000, random5000 is equal. And time is bigger than sort 2.
Than it is selection sort
